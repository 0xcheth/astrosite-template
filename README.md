# Che's cms+website template

Currently building using [Astro](https://astro.build/) but I have plans to integrate selfhosted [Tina](https://tina.io/) but before that I just want to clean up the code so I can use MD for everything!

Its currently a working progress and I'm trying to modularize all the main pages and set them all up to work with just MD for ease of use but thats proving harder than I expected :p

#### any help is appreciated!
