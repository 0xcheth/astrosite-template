First post on my first full-stack development project as a hobbyist.

This website is predominantly coded in astro with some java script and css elements. I  pretty much had to learn these languages on the go due to having no prior knoledge but it was fun and I'm still learning!

Github repo for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/0xcheth/0xcheth.github.io/tree/main" target="_blank">here</a> or you could find it on my github profile linked in the social sections.
